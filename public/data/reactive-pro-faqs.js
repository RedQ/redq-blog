      <p><a href="http://reactive.redq.io/video-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://reactive.redq.io/video-guide/</a></p>
      <p>Now at this point, it's ok to guess that you have a&nbsp;<strong>basic wordpress knowledge</strong>&nbsp;and you also have covered our&nbsp;<strong>pre-requirements</strong>, properly read our&nbsp;<strong>documentation</strong>, watched our&nbsp;<strong>video tutorials.&nbsp;</strong>But Still, you are having trouble Understanding How to work with the plugin and Have your Required search functionality. Don't worry To help you We have our Dedicated Technical Support team who will help you to achieve your goal. But to make it quicker we need to work closely so that you can complete the project before the deadline. By close i mean you need to provide proper information so that our technical team can quickly understand your issues and help you to fix it as soon as possible. I am adding common issues and some tips on how you should ask for help in the support forum based on our experiences till now. Though common issues have been discussed thought this&nbsp;<strong>FAQ</strong>&nbsp;section you can have a look at this section in the below FAQ to know about it more.</p>
      <p><strong>Common Issues:</strong></p>
      <p><em><strong>a) The most common issues we heard in the support forum is that nothing is working after installing the plugin.</strong></em>&nbsp;well, it can happen if you didn't setup the free helper add-ons redq-reuse-form or it can also happen because of a third party plugin conflict. we have created a faq for that which you can find below faq<em>&nbsp;</em><strong>vi)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>I have setup the plugin but nothing is working?&nbsp;</strong>if it still doesn't fix your issue you need to ask in the support site specifying that you have followed our faq that i've mention above and followed the steps thats been described but in some steps, you are having trouble or you have issues with a third party plugin by specifying the plugin name.</p>
      <p><strong>b)&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Another issues we heard is how to use the plugin to achieve your goal?</strong></em>&nbsp;Well if you have the pre-requirement and followed the above steps properly you should have a basic idea about the plugin, but if you still have trouble you need to ask in the support forum by specifying what's your goal or what kind of search page and functionality you need with proper details so that the support forum can send you the steps quickly and you can follow them to do that.</p>
      <p><strong>c)&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>What kind of information or data is needed to be on your site to search for them?&nbsp;</strong>Again This steps is very&nbsp;</em><strong>important</strong>&nbsp;to create your search page, The below data or information is needed for search page in your site:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>You need to know which post type you want to search and also you need to have this post type with posts be ready in your site before your proceed with our plugin though you can work simultaneously with our plugin and your post type with some test posts (by post_type i mean post, product, portfolio, car etc) but the recommended way to do that is to have all your posts ready so that you can tests them with our plugin.</li>
         <li>To search your posts you need to have your taxonomy and meta related with that post type ready so that you can use the taxonomy or meta to search your posts via checkbox, dropdown, range etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em><strong>d) What kind of information i need to provide in the support forum to solve my issues?&nbsp;</strong>_Well this is another tricky part you need to inform them about your requirement in proper details such as&nbsp;<strong>what is Reactive Builder? what post type i should select in Reactive Builder? How to Search parent child category etc?&nbsp;</strong>with your issues details, it helps the support team to understand better your issue if you provide them some screenshot and also inform them&nbsp;</em><strong>which post type you want to search and what is the related information such as taxonomy and meta you have(important).&nbsp;</strong>_To make it even better you can provide the below information,</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Plugin version you are using</li>
         <li>helper addons version you are using</li>
         <li>which step you have already followed</li>
         <li>at what situation you are having the issues</li>
         <li>since when you are having the issues</li>
         <li>at which update you are having the issue</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>e) The documentation is too difficult to understand?&nbsp;</strong>You gotta understand that Having a search functionality with your requirement is no simple work. Its a months of work to create a search functionality. But our plugin is here not only to save your efforts but also it give you lots of settings and functionality to make your search page customization easy. There are lots of Searching plugin in the market with easy settings but none of them will provide you with so much functionality, customization like ours. Plus we are give you a Frontend page builder system to create your search page which is supper flexible. It takes people days to learn the basic steps of a new page builder (if you don't know how this page builder works). But I hope our plugin doesn't take it that long and once you master of it you can create search pages for your of clients (Having a search functionality is one of the work thats have a huge demand in both on and off the freelance market) easily. About the difficult part if you follow our direction and contact with the support forum they will make it easier for you to understand also we are continuously working on a more easier User friendly UI and documentation. But keep in mind that A complex work with a Flexible and customization feature based plugin will take some time from you. At least it's worth the time to give it a proper try. And you are not alone a dedicated support team is waiting there for you to help.</p>`,

That's why we haven't tried to bring the feature and at that moment it's not possible to provide this feature either.</p>
    <p>if you need to use the simple custom meta field we recommend using our free plugin&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/reuse-builder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuse Builder&nbsp;</a>instead of other advance custom meta field plugin.</p>
    <p>the advance meta field it will only work it a single data for example if you have a meta checkbox field and you select only one value then it may work but in case of multiple select, it may not work. that's why we don't recommend.</p>`,

    <p>First of all, you need to know exactly why we have built the image picker and why you should use it,</p>
    <p>We have built the image picker to make a meaning full search component in your site, unlike checkbox, radio box it will show images of your taxonomy term meta. For example, if you have property on your site and you want to show images of your property type you can use our image picker in this case. it will look like the below image,</p>
    <img src=${img13} alt="" width="267" height="526" scale="0">
    <p>It will behave exactly like any checkbox or radio box component. so, now let's see what we have exactly done to create this component. as I've already informed you we have used here the term meta. if you don't know what is term meta please search it on google as in our pre-requirement we assume that you have a good idea about post type, taxonomy, meta and term meta. if you don't know about it you have to learn about this and you can use our below plugin to create them,</p>
    <p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/reuse-builder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuse Builder</a></p>
    <p>so, here's what we've done,</p>
    <p>i) Fist we have created a custom post type called&nbsp;<code>Property</code></p>
    <p>ii) then we have created a custom taxonomy called&nbsp;<code>Property type</code></p>
    <p>iii) then we have created an image type term meta for&nbsp;<code>Property Type</code></p>
    <p>if you have successfully created the above steps and created your terms, here's what it looks like on my site,</p>
    <img src=${img14} alt="" width="1122" height="671" scale="0">

    <p><strong>Image: Property Type Term page</strong></p>
    <p>so, if you have everything done successfully if you have something similar to the above steps.</p>
    <p>now, take an image picker in your search page.</p>
    <img src=${img16} alt="" width="1219" height="345" scale="0">
    now from the settings panel of image picker choose the term meta and your term meta name,

    <img src=${img18} alt="" width="411" height="179" scale="0">The Color Picker only works with Taxonomy Term Meta. if you don't know what is Term meta please check our FAQ number 1, So, as it only works with your Term meta, you have to create a taxonomy like in the above point Posts Color where you have all the color names and for each term using the term meta you can set a color. To use the color picker in your term meta we suggest using our own plugin, here is the link&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/reuse-builder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://wordpress.org/plugins/reuse-builder/</a>. so if you have created the color term meta and have your color names selected in your every post you can use the color picker search component in the reactive page, where you just have to select the term meta and term meta name in the color picker settings name.
    <p>NB: Please note that you must have to select the related post type, taxonomy, term meta name in the rebuilder shortcode.</p>

    <p>II) The plugin is built on top of advance javascript to provide features like the drag, drop, resize, fast search etc.</p>
    <p>as it's an advance javascript it has latest browser technology enabled which is not available in the old browsers such as Internet Explorer or Old Safari browsers(safari version above 10 is supported by our plugin).</p>

    <p>iv) If you are desperate to find a solution for your internet explorer or your old safari browser user you can follow one of our user who has implemented code that checks the old browsers on the reactive page and asked the customer to update to a new browser or change the browser to firefox or chrome by showing a notice. Unfortunately, we don't know what the user has done in the code section so you may have to do this part by your own or by hiring a developer you can achieve this too.</p>
