Medicine, being one of the key essentials of our lives - particularly during this pandemic, is a product that will always be in demand. While the current global crisis is wreaking havoc on traditional brick and mortar stores, E-commerce however, offers a unique [opportunity](https://redq.io/blog/starting-an-online-business-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/) for entrepreneurs to address this demand for medicine through a virtual marketplace and still generate sustainable revenue at a time when traditional businesses are struggling just to survive.

Where to start though? E-commerce templates are a dime a dozen these days. There is no lack of niche templates, including medicine E-commerce themes either, each vocally touting its own features as the very best in the market. Within this loud noise, it can be difficult to identify the right choice for your pharmaceutical business. In the race to get more traction, most medicine E-commerce developers seem to forego a basic aspect of product development - functionality within simplicity. This is exactly where [Medsy](https://themeforest.net/item/medsy-react-medicine-ecommerce-template-with-google-sheet-next-js/28462171) makes a difference.

## **Why Medsy**

Medsy is a one of a kind medicine centric E-commerce template that offers the perfect blend of simplicity and functionality. With its clean, efficient look, intuitive design and a powerful back-end working behind the simplistic facade, there really is no other like it. Unlike any other medicine E-commerce template, Medsy is React based and offers Google Sheet integration which makes maintaining your product inventory a breeze. It is also versatile and can be deployed on multiple platforms with no hassle. On top of all that, it has multiple layouts that will cater to people with even the most discerning aethetic needs. So, a better question would be - why _NOT_ Medsy?

## **Google Sheet Integration**

![Medsy, Google Sheet and Next JS](/assets/blog/images/Medsy-2.jpg)Spit out jargon like coding language, back-end, admin dashboard, inventory overhaul and you are bound to daunt people. However, spreadsheets are common, every day tools that even students use. Medsy combines the simplicity of [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) with the power and functionality of [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/) platforms to offer perhaps the easiest way to maintain and update your product repository as well as keep track of orders. Simply update your inventory list on Google Sheets and it will show up on the front-end. Again, once orders keep coming in, Medsy will auto populate another Google Sheet with the list of pending orders and make life easy for you. In this aspect, Medsy is indeed one of a kind and using it is really that simple!

## **Highly Customizable and Versatile**

You can add upon the pre-built template and modify the design to your satisfaction without ever having to change the core HTML code. Whether you want to add/ remove features or implement your own ideas, it all can be done very easily.

Another aspect is that it is very versatile and is developed to be deployed on any hosting service. Whether [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) or any other platform really, its makes no difference - just choose what is right for you and you’re all set!

## **Multiple Responsive Designs and Regular Updates**

On top of that, it has three layouts - Modern, Classic and Minimal - one of which is bound to cater to your needs. All these designs are efficient and intuitive to use, for both yourself and your customers. Further to this, as stated above, Tailwind CSS integration means you can customize further according to your needs.
