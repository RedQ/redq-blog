### As we all know, WooCommerce  Comes with 4 default product types.

1. **Simple Product.**
2. **Grouped Product.**
3. **External/ Affiliate product.**
4. **Variable Product.**

In the rental plugin, We create a new product type named rental product for all of our settings and options.

That is, in your site, you can use the simple or variable or grouped product for one of your product and you can also use the rental product for another product.

The plugin has a lot of features with simple settings. In this article, we will discuss all the features step by step.

## **Inventory Management**

Inventory is the most wanted feature and available now from v2.0.0. Now if you have 5 same products, you don't need to create 5 individual products for them. You just need to create 1 product from the inventory tab you need to configure these 5 same items.

Now every payable or non-payable attributes such as `pickup location`,`drop-off locations`,`resources`,`person`,`security deposite`,`attributes`,`features` are controlled with this inventory tab.

You just need to create inventory first and then attach the inventory with the product.

First, you need to create your `pickup location`,`drop-off locations`,`resources`,`person`,`security deposite`,`attributes`,`features`. and then attach these with the inventory.

Then you need to set the pricing of the inventory and the quantity of the inventory.

### **Price Calculation**

The rental plugin has some types of pricing plan like

- General pricing
- Hourly Pricing
- Daily Pricing
- Monthly Pricing
- Day Ranges Pricing

Now we will discuss all the pricing plans step by step and how the pricing plan works. The pricing can be set from the inventory and you can also add the quantity of the inventory.

### **General Pricing Plan:**

When you set a general pricing plan for a single product this price will be applied for each day during your booking.

![](/assets/blog/images/import5.png)

### **Hourly Pricing Plan:**

Our plugins support an hourly pricing system if you want to book less than 1 day. However for that from the backend of the WooCommerce settings you need to deselect single day booking (if that is already selected).

![](/assets/blog/images/5import.png)



Now our hourly pricing has two types: 1) General Hourly Pricing and, 2) Hourly Range Pricing.

#### 1) General Hourly Pricing

![](/assets/blog/images/Screenshot_3.png)

#### 2) Hourly Range Pricing

![](/assets/blog/images/Screenshot_4.png)

## **Daily Pricing Plan:**

Daily pricing plan allows you to set a different price for each day of a week. When you book this product the price will be calculated depending on the day's price.

![](/assets/blog/images/1import.png)

### **Monthly Pricing Plan:**

A monthly pricing plan allows you to set a different price for each month of a Year. When you book this product the price will be calculated depending on the monthly price.

![](/assets/blog/images/2import.png)

### **Day Ranges Pricing Plan:**

This plugins also allow you to set an unlimited day ranges pricing plan like the following image.

![](/assets/blog/images/3import.png)



You can set minimum days and maximum days for your date range. Please look at the option named applicable.

It is an important feature for the day range pricing plan. It will be either

Per Day

or

Fixed

A simple example will clear the difference between the two options.

Min day-1

Max day-4

Day Range Cost- 12

Applicable - Fixed

If someone book that product for 4 days, It will cost $12(not $12\*4=\$48). Because you set the applicable option to fixed.

It is helpful when you want to provide a package to your customer for a specific day range.

Now,

Min day-1

Max day-4

Day Range Cost- 12

Applicable - Per Day

Now, If someone book that product for 4 days, It will cost  $12\*4=$48. Because you set the applicable option to per day basis. Isn't it quite an impressive feature??

The plugin team is trying to provide some extra pricing plan like weekly pricing and Seasonal Pricing. It will add with the current features on their future updates.

## **Price Discount**

Price Discount option is available for all of the pricing plan. You can set a discount for a specific day range.

Discount type is available both on a Fixed price basis and percentage basis.

![](/assets/blog/images/price-discount.png)

Suppose, you set a price in general pricing plan and that is \$12. And if someone book within 2-4 days, you want to give them discounts. Then this option is for you.

Discount type is available in a fixed price or percentage of the price you set in the pricing calculation section.

Suppose, you set the discount type to a fixed price and that is \$5.

If someone book or rent your product for 3 days, the total price will be $12\*3=36-5=$31.

On the other side, Suppose, you set the discount type to percentage and that is 10%.

If someone book or rent your product for 3 days, the total price will be $12\*3=36\*10%= $32.40.

This is a cool feature.  There can be also some factors behind that. If you want to provide a special opportunity for your customers like you want to

give a 50% discount if someone book more than 10 days, Then set min days to 10 and set max days to 365 or any big amount of days.

Again, If you want to give a discount for only  7 days, not more or less, then set min days to 7 and max days to 7 also.

### **Availability**

Now product availability is totally controlled by inventory items.

Suppose you have a product named "polo shirt" which you want to rent out. You have 6 of these with 2 small, 2 medium and 2 large shirts available.

So you need to create 3 inventories and you can give them the name "small", "medium" and "large" or any other of your liking.

While you create the inventories you add the categories, resources, pick up location, drop off location, etc. as per your requirement and publish the inventories.

So now you will have inventories like below



![](/assets/blog/images/7import.png)

Now you need to attach the inventory with the "polo shirt"



![](/assets/blog/images/8import.png)

This will now mean that you have 6 polo shirts of 3 different sizes and a user can book.

Then availability is controlled with these child posts of the inventory items.

### **Resources (payable)**

`Resource` is taxonomy of `Inventory` post type. You can find this here Dashboard->Inventory->Resources. You can add unlimited from here.

### **Location(Pickup Location and Drop-off location)**

Like the other attributes, Pickup Location and Drop-off location are also taxonomies of the inventory post type.

You can find this option from Dashboard->Inventory->Pickup Location and Dashboard->Inventory->Dropoff Location. The beauty of the RnB plugin is,

someone can add unlimited pickup and drop-off locations from here. Then if you want to put the cost on this location, you can do it or vice versa.

**Pickup Location**

![](/assets/blog/images/ba-12.png)

**DropOff Location**

![](/assets/blog/images/ba-13-1.png)

Here, the Description option is compulsory. If you don't fill up your location description, Then the location will have vanished from the product cart page.

So you should fill the Description portion for the location.

![](/assets/blog/images/ba-14.png)

### Attributes and Features (non-payable)

Both Attributes and Features are non-payable taxonomies. You can find this option from Dashboard->Inventory->Attributes and Dashboard->Inventory->Features.
