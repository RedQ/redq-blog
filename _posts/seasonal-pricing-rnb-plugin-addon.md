**N\*\***ote:\*\* Multiplier value can not be negative. Multiplier value will multiply the existing price amount for the chosen duration. Such as Start Datetime 2019-11-06 13:20:40 and End Datetime 2019-11-30 13:20:47. All the booking price will be multiplied during this duration. If you have more than two seasonal pricing plans and the duration of these pricing plans are overlapped then the prioritized pricing plan will be executed. You can change the priority by the drag button.

## How it works

Seasonal pricing is the greatest solution for you to set different kinds of pricing plans for different duration. If you have a booking business and you want to give the customers a discounted price for a certain duration you can set it via seasonal pricing Add-On.

Example:

![How it works](/assets/blog/images/21-1.png "How it works")

Here you set a time duration via seasonal price and set 0.5 as the multiplier. So if your customer book during this duration and general price is 100 then he will have to pay 0.5\*100=50

If you set the multiplier 2.0 then the price will be 2.0\*100=200
