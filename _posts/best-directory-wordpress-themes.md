The Quick Start guide will enable you to run your site at any point, allowing you to have a good overview of the different features and settings before you start adding content.

To allow you to build your custom page layouts which are designed for your preferences and those of your community, the theme makes use of content blocks and modules that can be dragged and dropped into place. These blocks include content units such as featured places, hot spots, recent reviews, services, testimonials, reviews, and categories. Units can also be added to any of the sidebar areas as widgets, giving you a lot of flexibility to build your home and internal page layouts.

For end users, submitting a list to your directory is very clear thanks to front-end rendering formats. The whole process is seamlessly integrated with the rest of your website and does not even require any additional page loading thanks to the use of AJAX in its construction.

Every place added to the directory gets its own page which can be used to display that list. These individual pages can include maps, large images, videos, as well as all relevant business details.

When it comes to browsing the site, the theme of this directory makes it very easy for visitors to view data cards, while displaying relevant listings continuously without any page reloading for a smooth user experience.

Menus can be browsed by exploring the map, searching the directory, or filtering them using categories. Using site fields, users can filter results within a specific radius to find a business that is nearby. Users can also add lists to their favorites for quick access to visits back to your site.
