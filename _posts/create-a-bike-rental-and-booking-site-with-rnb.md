## **Bike Rent**

Now a day’s people want to rent everything through the internet, renting a bike through the internet is a new phenomenon. ”**RnB**” is a woo commerce plugin extension that will let you do such thing very conveniently. As a WooCommerce extension “**RnB**” has some features. Its features are as below:

- ### **Inventory Management**

  Without inventory management, nothing could run smoothly. That is why “**RnB**” comes up with a strong inventory management system. So Inventory is the most wanted feature and available now from v2.0.0. Now if you have 5 same products, you don't need to create 5 individual products for them. You have to create 1 product from the inventory tab so you need to configure these 5 same items.

This inventory tab will control every payable or non-payable attributes such as _pickup location, drop-off locations, resources, person, security deposit, attributes_, and _features_.

Inventory item should be set so during product creation one default inventory item will be created with product name automatically. Then by editing inventory item you can set _pickup location, drop-off locations, resources, person, security deposit, attributes,_ and _features_.

At the very beginning, you need to create your _pickup location, drop-off locations, resources, person, security deposit, attributes,_ and _features_. From each particular taxonomy which is available in Inventory post type.

Inventory fully works in two steps. The Attributes fields like _resources, persons, deposits, location_ will not appear from inventory while you first give input (like first screen-shot). In this situation, you've to click the update button of the product. Expand the necessary icon of inventory item field then click on it you will find these fields to attach the attributes (like second screen-shot).

- ## **Price Calculation**

  Our plugins support five types of pricing plan. You can choose one of these plenties according to your need.

1. **General pricing plan.**

2. **Daily pricing plan.**

3. **Monthly pricing plan.**

4. **Days ranges pricing plan.**

5. **Hourly pricing plan.**

6. **General pricing plan:** Meanwhile you set general pricing plan for a single product this price will be applied for each day during your booking plan. General pricing is a simple pricing plan. All the days will calculate the same price if you set general pricing for your products. If you have many products and all the products have some fixed price, then General pricing will be helpful for you.![](https://d2qklehrvrfpx7.cloudfront.net/blogimages/bikerental3.png)

7. **Daily pricing plan:** Daily pricing plan is one of the most interesting features of our pricing plan. Daily Pricing plan is for you if your product has a different price for every single day. Daily pricing plan allows you to set a different price for each day of a week. Meanwhile booking this product the price will be calculated depending on the day’s price. Hourly price is also included in the daily pricing plan. But be alert that, Hourly price will work perfectly with the daily pricing plan if you book less than a day.![](https://d2qklehrvrfpx7.cloudfront.net/blogimages/bikerental4.png)

8. **Monthly Pricing Plan:** Monthly pricing plan allows you to set a different price for each month of a Year. While you book this product the price will be calculated depending on the monthly price. Different price for a different month!!! How cool is that!

![](https://d2qklehrvrfpx7.cloudfront.net/blogimages/bikerental5.png)4\.

4. **Days ranges pricing plan\*\***:\*\* This plugins also allow you to set unlimited day ranges pricing plan by setting day ranges through the plugins set day ranges option.

![](https://d2qklehrvrfpx7.cloudfront.net/blogimages/bikerental6.png)

You can set minimum days and maximum days for your date range. Please look at the option named applicable. It is an important feature for the day range pricing plan. It will be either

Per Day

Or

Fixed

A simple example will clear the difference between the two option.

Min day-1

Max day-4

Day Range Cost- 12

Applicable – Fixed

If someone book that product for 4 days, It will cost $12(not $12\*4=\$48). Because you set the applicable option to fixed. It is helpful when you want to provide a package to your customer for a specific day range.

Now,

Min day-1

Max day-4

Day Range Cost- 12

Applicable – Per Day

While somebody book that product for 4 days, It will cost  $12\*4=$48. Because you set the applicable option to per day basis. Isn’t it a quite impressive feature??

The plugin team is trying to provide some extra pricing plan like weekly pricing and Seasonal Pricing. It will be added with the current features on their future updates.

5. **Hourly pricing plan:** Our plugins support hourly pricing system if you want to book less than 1 day.

- **Price Discount -** RnB also provides price discount feature depending on booking days. Admin can set unlimited booking day-ranges price discount from product back-end. Price Discount option is available for the entire pricing plan.
- You can set a discount for a specific day range. Discount type is available both on a _Fixed_ price basis and percentage basis.
- You can set your discount type as *Fixed price or* *Percentage*![](https://d2qklehrvrfpx7.cloudfront.net/blogimages/bikerental7.png)

Supposedly, you set a price in the general pricing plan and that is \$12. And if someone book within 2-4 days, you want to give them discounts. Then this option is for you.

Discount type is available in Fixed price or percentage of the price you set in the pricing calculation section.

Supposedly, you set the discount type to a fixed price and that is \$5.

If someone book or rent your product for 3 days, the total price will be $12\*3=36-5=$31.

On the other side, Suppose, you set the discount type to percentage and that is 10%.

If someone book or rent your product for 3 days, the total price will be $12\*3=36\*10%= $32.40.

This is a cool feature.  There can be also some factors behind that. If you want to provide a special opportunity to your customers like you want to give 50% discount if someone book more than 10 days, Then set min days to 10 and set max days to 365 or any big amount of days.

Again, If you want to give a discount for only  7 days, not more or less, then set min days to 7 and max days to 7 also.

- **Availability -** Inventory items are the term now product availability is controlled within it.

Suppose you have two inventory items in a product, you can choose them both as the following screenshot.![](https://d2qklehrvrfpx7.cloudfront.net/blogimages/bikerental8.png)
