1. Type of hosting - There are different types of packages available depending upon your needs. Understanding your needs and how much web resources you require is the first step. If you have a small to the medium website, then shared hosting will do fine for you. VPS hosting is for fast-growing websites that need greater server performance. VPS also offers faster data access and more storage than shared hosting. If you have a big website with lots of customers and traffic, then dedicated hosting will be perfect for you. If you choose to opt for dedicated hosting, you will have an entire server dedicated to your website.
2. Type of your website - The second thing to understand is what type of website you are building. If you want a website to host your content, then WordPress is perfect for you. It is easy and reliable enough to work with for content writers. On the other hand, if you are building an online store, the e-Commerce hosting service will be best suited to your needs. If you have zero experience in building websites, you can choose a host that provides web-building tools
3. Resources - The third thing to consider is the resources you would require. Resources mean storage, security, bandwidth, domain registration, e-mail addresses, RAM, data transfer, etc. All web hosting services will be providing a mix-and-match of all of these at different levels. Choose a service that best caters to your needs.
4. Cost - While free hosting sounds charming, usually, it might not be that great. free hosting comes with minimal services and resources. The price should depend upon the resources and server capacity you are demanding. If you want good service, you will have to pay adequately. Compare prices amongst a few web hosting services you have shortlisted and chose the one that you seem best.
5. Think Ahead - This is one of the most important aspects you have to keep in mind. Look ahead and see how you want your website will turn out to be. This will give you a general sense of direction your website will be going in. You should choose a web hosting service that your website can grow with. Choosing a different host, later on, will be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming.
