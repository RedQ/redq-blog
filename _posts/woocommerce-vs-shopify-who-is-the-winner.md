You can utilize these platforms with minimum coding knowledge, and a lot of tutorials are already available to do so. But interestingly, WooCommerce is slightly better than Shopify.

## What is Shopify?

[Shopify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopify) is an E-Commerce business platform developed by Canadian company Shopy Inc. It provides online retailers a suite of services which are including payments, marketing, shipping, and customer engagement tools to simplify the process of running an online store for small merchants. It was founded in 2004.

## WooCommerce has many Plugins & Product Add-Ons

Different kinds of E-Commerce store owners need different kinds of features. WooCoomerce has a vast amount of features to choose from. As an example, WooCommerce Image Zoom is an excellent feature for retailers selling products with fine details. It also provides a Bulk Discount plugin, which helps shoppers save money when they purchase more of your goods. WooCommerce itself has a lot of plugins and Add ons, and there are hundreds of WooCommerce extensions available many of which are free.

Developers are consistently developing plugins and themes for WooCommerce. Making a multi-lingual site is very easy, which assists customers a lot. Your E-Commerce store has endless opportunities to be customized. So naturally, WooCommerce provides flexibility to build an E-Commerce store. And this platform is best due to these reasons.

## Best Checkout Process By WooCommerce

WooCommerce provides the best Checkout Process among all platforms available. WooCommerce not only rich in features but also clearly ahead on providing a smooth and customizable Checkout Process. The Checkout Process is vital for an E-Commerce store. E-Commerce business has colossal competition, so if you want your business should survive, then a smooth and fast Checkout process would be your priority.

WooCommerce has a built-in payment method system, and it can accept payments via PayPal and Stripe, as well as adjustable tax and shipping rates. WooCommerce also offers options like the use of multiple coupons and guest checkout. There are also lots of plugins available to support many payment gateways, along with other ways to customize and simplify checkout.

## WooCommerce is Budget oriented

Budget is always a factor for the E-Commerce store owners. A new business start-up might not have a huge budget to start. With a limited budget, a small business owner wants to grow his business instantly. So obviously, he can not afford a platform which costs him a lot. Naturally, he will try to secure a platform with vast capabilities but has to spend less money.

At the start of the E-Commerce business, the owner has to pay for hosting service and domain name and service. So he might have little left to pay on the store platform. So genuinely, WooCommerce comes forward to assist him in this matter with attractive pricing.

WooCommerce has long been addressed as a more cost-effective platform compared to others. With hosting providers such as Bluehost, WooCommerce retailers can receive a free domain name, SSL certificate, and web hosting for as little as $6.95/month. On the other hand, basic Shopify plans start at $29/month. While there are many paid themes and plugins available for WooCommerce, it is easy to find free versions with similar functions or features.

## Full Control Over Your Store

This is the main advantage of WooCommerce as a platform for an E-Commerce store. WooComerce will give you full freedom of control over your E-Commerce store. But Shopify will not let you have the full control over your E-Commerce store similar to WooComerce. For Shopify, you have to host your store solely on Shopify. Shopify is not as customizable as WooComerce. So obviously, you will feel you are bound to Shopify. You can design your E-commerce store with free or premium plugins and themes while you are using WooCommerce as the business platform.

## The vast opportunities of WordPress

WordPress is the most popular and free medium to build any website quickly with minimum coding knowledge—almost one-third of all existing websites based on WordPress. WordPress is well-known for its ease of use, 100% customizable website design, built-in blog, and search engine success rates.
