### Step 2: Choose a unique name for your business

After choosing the product type you want to sell, then move forward to think about your E-Commerce business's unique name. The name should not be too large, have to avoid complicated names, the name should be easy to memorize and obviously related to your business.

### Step 3: Secure Your Domain Name and Website

You will require a suitable domain name for your E-Commerce business. This domain name should be related to your real business name. For example, if your business's name is "Rent Car for Tour" then your domain name should be "www.rentcarfortour.com/org/biz" etc. If this is not available, you will have to try something similar to your business's name. You can use "www.tourbyrentcar.com/org/biz" etc. Actually, the name should be smooth and at least 60% identical to your original business's name. After choosing a domain name, you have to select a platform to build your website. You can choose any [pre-built template](https://themeforest.net/item/pickbazar-react-graphql-ecommerce-template/25283305) to start your E-Commerce site or create an E-Commerce business template of your own. If you want to start your E-Commerce business earlier, then choosing a [pre-built template](https://themeforest.net/item/picksy-react-gatsby-grocery-ecommerce-template/26576621) is an ideal solution.

### Step 4: Select The Best Business Structure and Register Your Business

This step is about your business structure. You have got several options when it comes to your business structure:

- [Sole Proprietor](https://www.sba.gov/content/sole-proprietorship)

- [LLC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/llc.asp)
- [Corporation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporation.asp)

If there are no partners in your business, then you are Sole Proprietor; otherwise, partnerships should be mentioned in the "About Us" page or in the Company profile. Both the corporation and LLC separate you and your assets from the business and provide other tax benefits.

You can register on your own by filling out the appropriate business structure paperwork from the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/) (for USA) yourself, or you can hire a business filing company to do it for you. A lawyer is another option, but that is often over-killing for the average small business owner’s needs.

### Step 5: Apply for Business Licenses and Permits
