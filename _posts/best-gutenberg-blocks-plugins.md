For instance – you can add ‘Testimonial’ to your content using such block plugins. The opportunities are countless with these different plugins. Lots of WordPress developers are really concerned about developing and publish different kinds of 'Gutenberg' optimized plugins.

## What is Gutenberg and Gutenberg Block?

The Gutenberg WordPress editor is a brand new page builder that is being designed to integrate with WordPress core. It is named after Johannes Gutenberg, who invented a printing press with movable type more than 500 years ago. The current visual editor actually requires a lot of programmers or developers as a team to utilize shortcodes and HTML to make things work. So to make everything so easy, particularly for those just starting with WordPress, the organization of WordPress embracing “little blocks” and hope to add more advanced layout options. Gutenberg will add page builder-like options and content blocks to every updated WordPress based site. Meanwhile, in utilization, it will take the place of TinyMCE as the content editor by default. With Gutenberg editor, content is added in blocks of various types from the WordPress backend. Gutenberg is slated to be released with WordPress 5.0.

### What is a Gutenberg Blocks Plugin?

If a plugin is solely developed utilizing Gutenberg Blocks, then this plugin could be categorized as Gutenberg Blocks Plugin. It should work like Gutenberg Blocks. Naturally, it will enhance the functionalities of Gutenberg Editor. Such kinds of blocks are Price list, Accordion, Social share, etc.

## How to utilize Gutenberg blocks to create a WordPress post? (3 steps procedures)

Assuming you have updated your site to WordPress 5.0, your site should use the new Gutenberg editor by default. Now you are really ready to learn how to apply the new Gutenberg blocks system. In this article, We are going to illustrate the editor’s key features by walking you through what it is like to create a basic WordPress post, but you can use the same approach no matter what type of content you are generating with Gutenberg.

### Step No 1: Add a block to your post

At the very beginning, you will need to give your post a unique title, utilizing the dedicated field at the top of the editor:

![Add Title](/assets/blog/images/Add-Title.png)

This performs exactly the same way as it did in the previous classic editor. Very Next, more ever, things start to manipulate.

If you hover over the area directly under your post’s title, you will see a few icons there:

![gutenberg editor icons](/assets/blog/images/gutenberg-editor-icons.png)

The _Plus_ icon grants you choose Gutenberg blocks and add them to your post. On the right, there are also some options to quickly add the most commonly-used blocks – image, the text, and gallery options.

Right now, click on the _Plus_ icon, and you will see a new menu:

![gutenberg select block](/assets/blog/images/gutenberg-select-block.png)

This menu numbers out all the Gutenberg blocks that the editor currently includes. There is a section at the top position with your own _Most Used_ options, a number of organized categories beneath, and even a search bar to assist you in finding what you require quickly.

To attach a block to your post, you just need to find and click on it. So let us begin with a _Paragraph_ block. Put the block in your post, then go forward to the next step (_you may also create a paragraph block by modestly typing in the editor_).

### Step No 2: Customizing your block

When you add a paragraph block, it does not look like much right away. Nevertheless, once you begin to start typing into the field, new options will appear:

![text block formatting options](/assets/blog/images/text-block-formatting-options.png)

You will see some fundamental formatting settings, such as bold and italics, alignment. Additionally, check out the right-hand sidebar of the editor's screen:

![text block sidebar settings](/assets/blog/images/text-block-sidebar-settings.png)



There, you will find more block-specific functions. In this scenario, you can change the text’s font color and size, add a drop cap, and even include some custom CSS (in the _Advanced_ menu). Any modifications you make, either here or on the block itself, will be immediately visible.

Every single Gutenberg blocks offered comes with its own unique settings.

For example, if you hit _Enter,_ you will add a new block under your paragraph block. Nonetheless, this time, you can try adding an image block by using that very same _Plus_ sign:

![gutenberg image block](/assets/blog/images/gutenberg-image-block.png)



As you can see, you are able to upload an image or add one that is already available in your Media Library. You may edit the image, alter its alignment, and add some CSS in the sidebar.

**Productivity hint:** As a replacement for hitting the _Plus_ sign, you can type a “/” in a vacant block followed by the name of the block that you desire to insert. Once you acknowledge which blocks are available, this is a much faster way to add new blocks.

There is no doubt that you will use plenty of images and paragraph blocks. However, Gutenberg has more to provide. There are also plenty of Gutenberg blocks providing new options not present in the classic editor.

As an example, you can add a _Button_ block to your post:

![gutenberg button block](/assets/blog/images/gutenberg-button-block.png)

This generates a clickable button for visitors to collaborate with. You may edit the text of the button itself, and integrate the URL. It will link to right below:

![gutenberg button block2](/assets/blog/images/gutenberg-button-block2.png)

By choosing the icon in the top-left corner of the block, you can manipulate the style of your button:



![gutenberg button block3](/assets/blog/images/gutenberg-button-block3.png)Additionally, you can alter both the text and background colors in the sidebar. While this is not a huge range of options, it is enough to create a useful customized button, which you can use to encourage visitors to sign up for an email list, buy a product, or whatever else strikes your fancy.

### Step No 3: Put the finishing touches to your post

Once you have added a few blocks, you can find yourself wanting to make some changes. Luckily, the Gutenberg editor is pretty flexible in letting you modify your content’s layout.

So, if you want to delete a block, such as, you can select the _Options_ icon above it, and click on the _Remove Block_:

![remove block](/assets/blog/images/remove-block.png)By hovering over a block, now you can use the up and down arrows to reorganize your blocks at will. Otherwise, you can also click on the _six dots_ between the arrows to use drag and drop to move a block:

![move block](/assets/blog/images/move-block.png)**Productivity hint:** Gutenberg editor includes a number of keyboard shortcuts that can assist you quickly delete blocks or insert new blocks. So, type **Shift + Alt + H** to view all the Gutenberg keyboard shortcuts.

It is also worth indicating that you can create multi-column layouts. This is an exciting feature. You may access it by placing a _Columns_ block in your post:

![gutenberg columns](/assets/blog/images/gutenberg-columns.png)

This lets you create up to six side-by-side columns, and place whatever blocks you would like within each one. It is an option that offers a lot of potential for creating unique layouts.

Finally, it is important to note you still have access to post-wide (or page-wide) settings as well. In the right-hand sidebar, click on the _Document_ tab to find them:

![gutenberg page settings](/assets/blog/images/gutenberg-page-settings.png)



Here, you will find most of the options you are familiar with. You can publish the post, set an author, choose categories and tags, add a featured image, and so on. You can even modify comments settings in the _Discussion_ menu. However, you would not need to save your content, as it will auto-save at frequent intervals while you are working.

This is all you require to know in order to use the Gutenberg blocks system.
