**React Native** is an open-source mobile application framework developed by Facebook.  It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Web and UWP by  enabling developers to use React along with native platform  capabilities. In addition, an incomplete port for Qt also exists. The  working principles of React Native are practically identical to React  excluding that React Native does not manipulate the DOM via the Virtual  DOM. It runs in a background process (which interprets the JavaScript  written by the developers) directly on the end-device and communicates  with the native platform via a serialization, batched and asynchronous  Bridge.

There are lots of communities continuously growing around the world  based on this React Native. Today we will talk about some great blogs on React Native.
