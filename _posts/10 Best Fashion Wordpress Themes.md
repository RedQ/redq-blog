Fashion Wordpress themes are a great tool to set up your online fashion store. Doing so is very necessary these days as more people than ever are shopping online these days. The ongoing pandemic has also encouraged more people to shop online. To help you on choosing from a vast array of fashion e-commerce themes, here's our pick of 10 Wordpress fashion themes that we think are truly top notch.

**1. [Cartsy](redq.io/cartsy)**

Cartsy is our first pick because of its simplistic yet functional design. Built on the widely popular [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/?aff=17277) platform, Cartsy as a fashion WooCommerce theme is truly phenomenal. 

It has a simplistic outlook, but beneath the minimal exterior lies a truly powerful backend. The sleek aesthetic aside, it is designed to be lightweight. That means super fast page speed and a very SEO friendly layout. Another great aspect is you don't need to have a coding background to use it - you can set it up yourself!

Combining the best practices from popular fashion WooCommerce themes, Cartsy comes with important features such as full responsiveness, [Gutenberg Blocks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-addons-for-gutenberg/), [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/), [Malichimp](https://mailchimp.com/) and many more.

Yet another great aspect is that its developers add new pre-built templates on popular product niches regularly, making it a highly customizable and truly multi purpose fashion WooCommerce theme.

Some key features are:

* Algolia Search
* SEO friendly
* Live demos
* WPML and superior support
* PWA suppor

**2. [NEVE](https://themeisle.com/themes/neve/?sscid=31k5_7mog9)**

Neve is another great fashion WooCommerce theme that also boasts fast speed and a somewhat minimalist design approach.

It is fully optimized with [Elementor](https://elementor.com/) and also has Gitenberg integration.

Although developed particularly with e-commerce agencies, startups and the like in mind, Neve as a fashion Wordpress theme is worth looking into.

Some features are:
