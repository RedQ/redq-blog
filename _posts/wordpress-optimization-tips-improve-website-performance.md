# Why is WordPress Optimization Important?

Although WordPress is the most popular website management system and blogging system which supports more than 60 million websites, it has a weakness that it suffers from, however, is it can be quite slow and steady to open a webpage.

That is why WordPress optimization is so important to improve the performance of a website.Without taking the right step by step procedures, you could end up with a slow and sluggish website.

WordPress [performance optimization](https://redq.io/blog/best-google-analytics-wordpress-plugin/) is always an important thing that should be atop priority, especially when there is so much online presence and competition. Website performance always influences your rankings in search engines. Moreover, if you want to make your website to be ranked higher, you must optimize your website.\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[vc\_single\_image image="110" img\_size="full" alignment="center"\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]\[vc\_row\]\[vc\_column\]\[vc\_column\_text\]Today, I am going to share with you five quick tips on how you can optimize your WordPress website and drastically reduce the flooding time of your WordPress Website. If you follow these techniques and best practices, your WordPress website will load much quicker.

## Improve Website Performance Tips:

Before applying these techniques and tips to your website, I recommend you to check the current speed of your website using a free performance service such as [GTMetrix](http://gtmetrix.com/), [YSlow](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/), [Google PageSpeed Insights](http://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/), [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/speed-tool/) or [Pingdom](https://pingdom.com).

These **free services** will inform you of your page loading time and the overall file size of your page. They also offer tips to **improve your page performance**.\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]\[vc\_row\]\[vc\_column\]\[vc\_column\_text\]

### Choose The Right Hosting Plan:

Hosting plays a vital role when you create a website. You can host your website with different hosting providers such as Bluehost, HostGator, GoDaddy or any local hosting services.

You may choose to host from the world best-hosting provider, but, still, your website can be slow due to the wrong selection of your hosting plan. When it is time to optimize your website correctly, you need to choose the right hosting plan.

However, any type of hosting plan will suffer from insufficient RAM and CPU throttling. Therefore, you need to pay attention to what your website needs to run smoothly. Do not be a cheapskate and go for the cheapest option. Choose a hosting plan that can handle traffic spikes efficiently.\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[vc\_single\_image image="111" img\_size="full" alignment="center"\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]\[vc\_row\]\[vc\_column\]\[vc\_column\_text\]

### Start Making Your Website With A Good Theme:

You might be surprised to hear this, but the [Twenty Seventeen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyseventeen/), the default WP theme is lightweight and quite speedy. Make the wise decision to choose light and [speedy WordPress theme](https://themeforest.net/item/turbo-car-rental-system-wordpress-theme/17156768?ref=redqteam). Choose a design that has been optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Search engines favor responsive designs as they ensure all pages have the same URL, however adaptive designs that were created specifically for mobile phones can improve a mobile user’s experience considerably (it is not uncommon for an adaptive design to reduce page size by over one megabyte).

Unfortunately, most [theme developers](https://redq.io/blog/how-to-use-a-wordpress-child-theme/) optimize their theme demo website using caching and content delivery networks. This thing makes it difficult to know how quick a WordPress design is before using it yourself.

### Install a Caching Plugin

The third most effective way to improve your site’s load times is to install a caching plugin. When you install a plugin like [W3 Total Cache](http://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/) or [WP Super Cache](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/), it’ll be easier to tell that your website is so fast than previous.

In simple words, when you are using a caching plugin on your site, its server’s users cached copies of your pages. It can easily and efficiently reduce MySQL database access, no. of PHP requests, server access for static resources, and even HTTP requests. Moreover, it can combine multiple files into one.\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[vc\_single\_image image="112" img\_size="full" alignment="center"\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]\[vc\_row\]\[vc\_column\]\[vc\_column\_text\]

### Optimize Uploaded Images:

Images are one of the heaviest elements of your website. This can make your website slow. There are a few ways you can reduce the sizes of the uploaded images and speed up the performance of your website.

It is, therefore, the best solutions to optimize your images before you upload them to your website.

Most photo editing applications, such as Photoshop, allow you to do optimize the images easily this via the “**Save for The Web**” option.

If you do not want to sacrifice the image quality, you can use [Lazy Load](http://wordpress.org/plugins/lazy-load/).This plugin ensures that images are only loaded when the area becomes visible to the user. This will greatly reduce page loading times.\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[vc\_single\_image image="113" img\_size="full" alignment="center" css\_animation="bounceIn"\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]\[vc\_row\]\[vc\_column\]\[vc\_column\_text\]

### Minify CSS and JavaScript:

If you minify your CSS and JavaScript, it will be more easy and efficient to make your website speedy and fast.The PHP5 application Minify combines multiple CSS and JavaScript files into a single file. This greatly reduces the number of HTTP requests. The application also helps you to remove unnecessary whitespace and comments.

There are a number of WordPress plugins available that will minify your CSS and JavaScript files. I always recommend using either [WP Minify](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-minify/) or [Better WordPress Minify](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bwp-minify/). You can try one of them to minify your CSS and JavaScript.\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]\[vc\_row\]\[vc\_column\]\[vc\_column\_text\]Slow load times not only create a bad impression about your site to your visitors, it’s also bad for your SEO. A load time of under 3 seconds is decent, under 2 seconds is impressive, and even less is blazing fast!

#### Conclusion:

You can also find some useful information about your site’s current performance. Not only that, you can improve it by testing your site in [Google PageSpeed Insights](http://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/).

The only thing great with WordPress is that it is very easy to optimize and accommodates plugins like fish to water.\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]
