GraphQL supports reading, writing, and subscribing to changes to data (realtime updates – most commonly implemented using WebHooks). GraphQL servers are available for multiple languages. It allows clients to define the required data structure, and the same data structure is returned from the server, that is why preventing excessively large amounts of data from being returned.
